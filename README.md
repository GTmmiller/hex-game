# hex-game

This is a simple implementation of the game [hex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)). Hex is an abstract strategy game where two opponents take turns choosing hexagons in an attempt to create an unbroken path from one side of the game board to another.

The goal of this project is to create a simple game of hex using [fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/). Currently, the end result will be single player game of hex with multiple behavior-based ai opponents.
